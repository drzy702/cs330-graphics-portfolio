# cs330-graphics-portfolio

Throughout this project, I learned how to approach designing software by thinking visually and structurally. I improved at using shapes and transformations to build recognizable objects and organizing them in a balanced scene. Following a step-by-step design process helped me stay focused—starting with planning my shelf layout, then creating individual models like the tree and Xbox. These same design tactics, like breaking down complex objects into smaller parts and using consistent textures, are things I can apply in future projects. When it came to developing the program, I learned to iterate often—testing object placement, lighting, and camera controls regularly to make sure everything worked smoothly. Each milestone helped me improve my approach and refine the code, making the final result more polished. This project showed me how computer science can support my creative and technical goals. Using computational graphics helped me understand how visualizations work behind the scenes and gave me new skills I can use in both educational and professional work, like breaking big problems into smaller tasks, using shaders, and managing a scene’s organization.
